The convenience comes with a price

It is undeniable that saving your password in Chrome is convenient. It helps you to log in to your website automatically while ensuring that your password is encrypted. The only way for the perpetrators to access your encrypted website password is to have your laptop username and password.


Typing your username and password into the windows login prompt to decrypt the website password
The false sense of security

To be honest, the windows login prompt is a weak security feature. Have you ever wondered how Chrome auto-fill the password fields without any prompt? This is because Chrome has saved your passwords somewhere else in the application.

Of note, they did not save in a secured location.

I am sharing this knowledge to raise awareness of this vulnerability and demonstrate how easy this can be exploited. You should not use this tool on unauthorised devices. Cheers!
